\section{The Discriminant}

\subsection{Quadratic Polynomials}
\begin{definition}[Quadratic discriminant]
	\label{definition:quadratic-discriminant}
	Let $p(x) = x^2 + bx + c$ be a polynomial with $b$ and $c$ real numbers.
	The discriminant $\Delta(p)$ is by definition $b^2 - 4c$.
\end{definition}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:}
	If the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 + bx + c$ has roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$, express $b$ and $c$
	in terms of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:quadratic-roots}
	What does the sign of the discriminant (i.e., whether $\Delta(p) > 0, < 0$ or $=0$) 
	tell you about the roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$?
	{\it Hint:} If the discriminant is $>0$ show that the roots are real, if it is equal
	to $0$, show they are the same, if it is less than $0$, show they are complex numbers
	which are not real.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:quadratic-discriminant-in-roots}
	Express the discriminant of the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 + bx + c$ in terms of
	the roots $\alpha, \beta$.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{The discriminant in general}
``\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:discriminant}
	For $p(x)$ a polynomial of the form $p(x) = (x-r_1)(x-r_2) \cdots (x-r_n)$,
	define the discriminant $\Delta(p) := \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (r_i - r_j)^2$.
\end{definition}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:}
	Verify that for $p(x)$ of degree $2$, the definition of the discriminant
	of a general polynomial from \autoref{definition:discriminant} agrees with
	that of a quadratic polynomial given in \autoref{definition:quadratic-discriminant}.
	{\it Hint:} Use \autoref{exercise:quadratic-discriminant-in-roots}.
\end{exercise}
The following exercise shows that the discriminant measures, in a precise sense, how far apart
the roots of a polynomial are.
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:}
	Show that for $p$ a polynomial, $\Delta(p) = 0$ if and only if $p$ has a repeated root.
\end{exercise}
\subsection{Cubic discriminants}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:real-root-cubic}
	Show that a cubic polynomial with real coefficients $p(x) = x^3 + ax + bx + c$
	always has a real root.
	{\it Hint:} Graph the cubic and show it intersects the line $p(x) = 0$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:}
	Using \autoref{exercise:real-root-cubic}, show that a cubic polynomial either has
	$3$ real roots or $2$ complex conjugates roots (of the form $a + bi, a-bi$ for $a,b$ real numbers) and one real root. 
	{\it Hint:} Factor out the real root, and use your understanding of quadratic polynomials.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:discriminant-cubic-sign}
	For $p(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ a cubic polynomial with real coefficients, show $\Delta(p) = 0$ if and only 
	if there is a repeated root, $\Delta(p) > 0$ if and only if $p$ has three distinct real roots, and $\Delta(p) < 0$ if and only if $p$ has two complex conjugate roots and one real root.
	Compare your answer to \autoref{exercise:quadratic-roots}.
\end{exercise}

\todo{aaron: i didn't discuss the formula for the cubic discriminant, but i think this is already perhaps too much material for one day, i think maybe you can just state it as a fact the formula that the discriminant of $x^3 + ax + b$ is $-4a^3-27b^2$ or whatever it is (and optionally allow them to expand it out but suggest they don't prove it since it seems boring and tedious) }

{\it Your homework is to complete up through \autoref{exercise:discriminant-cubic-sign}. If you finish that, and still have time try the following challenge questions.}

\subsection{Counting polynomials of discriminant $0$}
\begin{exercise}[Challenge 1]
	\label{exercise:repeated-roots}
	Let $p(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0$, where now the coefficients $a_i$ are
	in $\bz/p$ (i.e., take on values between $0$ and $p-1$), and the discriminant is
	also considered as a number in $\bz/p$. Show there are $p^n$ such polynomials, and exactly
	$p^{n-1}$ of them have discriminant $0$.
	Conclude that the number of squarefree polynomials of degree $n$ over $\bz/p$ is $p^n - p^{n-1}$.
	{\it Hint:} Try factoring the polynomials over $\bz/p$, and write each polynomial
	uniquely as $f(x)g(x)^2$, where $f(x)$ is squarefree. Then count the number
	of such polynomials for the degree of $f$ fixed inductively.	
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Challenge 2]
	\label{exercise:common-roots}
	Using a similar method to that of \autoref{exercise:repeated-roots},
	count the number of pairs of degree $n$ polynomials $(p,q)$ for 
	$p(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0$ and $q(x) = x^n + b_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + b_0$
	with $a_i \in \bz/p, b_i \in \bz_p$ so that $p$ and $q$ have no common root $\bmod p$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{remark}
	\label{remark:}
	If you did the two prior exercises \autoref{exercise:repeated-roots} and \autoref{exercise:common-roots} correctly, you may notice a striking similarity
between the two answers. There is in deed a deeper connection, but the answer lies deep.
Loosely speaking, if you take a polynomial $p(x)$ with no repeated roots, you can send it
to the pair of polynomials $(p(x) + p'(x), p(x))$. Here $p'(x)$ denotes the derivative of $p(x)$.
If $p(x) = \sum_i a_ix^i$ then $p'(x) = \sum_i  i \cdot a_i x^{i-1}$.
The diligent reader will check that this is a map from the space of polynomials with no repeated roots to the
space of pairs of polynomials with no repeated roots.
In some sense (which we do not explain) this map explains why the counts from 
\autoref{exercise:repeated-roots} and \autoref{exercise:common-roots} are so similar.
\end{remark}

\section{Solving the Cubic}

	
	
	
	
	
	\subsection{Discriminant of the Cubic}
	
	
	
	
	
	
	\subsection{The Solution}
		
		
	There is no unique way to find the roots of the cubic. 
	We'll choose the method that is motivated by Galois theory. 
	It'll look extremely mysterious but this is the method that generalizes to show that there is no formula for solving a general fifth degree polynomial. 
	We'll start with a \textbf{depressed cubic} (i.e. coefficient of $ x^2$ is 0) and come back to the more general cubic later. Consider cubic
		\begin{align*}
			P(x) &= x^3 + px + q
		\end{align*}
	and suppose the roots of $ P(x)$ are $ \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$.
	
	\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:coefficients_depressed_cubic}
		Express $ 0,p,q$ in terms of $ \beta_1$, $ \beta_3$, and $ \beta_3$.
	\end{exercise}

	\begin{exercise}
	We need some identities about the \emph{cube roots of unity} before proceeding.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find the three roots of the polynomial $ x^3 - 1$.
		\item Show that if $ \omega $ is a complex root of this equation then the other complex root is $ \omega^2$. Conclude that $ \overline{\omega} = \omega^2$.
    \item Compute $ \omega + \omega^2$.
		\item Plot $ \omega$, $\omega^2$ on the complex plane.
	\end{enumerate}
  $ \omega$ and $ \omega^2$ (and also 1) are called the \textbf{third roots of unity}.
	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
		\item Find the three solutions of $ x^3 = 2$. These are the three \emph{cube roots} of $ 2$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

  The method for solving the cubic is somewhat like induction, we reduce the problem to a lower degree one. We need to find \emph{intermediate constants} which satisfy a known \emph{quadratic} and from which $ \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$ can be easily recovered. And here they are:
	
	\begin{align}
    \mu_1 &= \beta_1 + \beta_2 \omega + \beta_3 \omega^2 \\
    \mu_2 &= \beta_1 + \beta_2 \omega^2 + \beta_3 \omega
  \end{align} 
			
	\begin{exercise}
		Find $ \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$ in terms of $ \mu_1, \mu_2$.\hint{Use the previous exercises.}
	\end{exercise}
	
	Our \emph{intermediate constants} are not $ \mu_1$ and $ \mu_2$ but $ \mu_1^3$ and $ \mu_2^3$.


	\begin{exercise}
		$ $ 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Use the previous exercise to find $ \beta_1. \beta_2.\beta_3$ in terms of $ \mu_1, \mu_2$. Use this to find $ \mu_1^3 + \mu_2^3$ in terms of $ p, q$.
			\item Find $ \mu_1 .\mu_2$ in terms of $ p,q$.
			\item Find the coefficients of the quadratic whose roots are $ \mu_1^3$ and $ \mu_2^3$ and solve it. (Do you recognize anyone here?)
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{exercise}
	
	\begin{mdframed}
		With all this work done, here's the algorithm for finding the roots of a depressed cubic $ x^3 + px + q$:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Find $ \mu_1^3$ and $ \mu_2^3$ by solving the quadratic you found in the previous exercise. 
			\item This unfortunately does not determine $ \mu_1$ and $ \mu_2$ uniquely. Pick $ \mu_1$ as any of the three \emph{cube roots} of one of the roots and use Part 2 of the previous problem to find $ \mu_2$.
			\item Use the previous exercise to find $ \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$ in terms of $ \mu_1, \mu_2$. 
			\item Feel happy about yourself.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{mdframed}
	
	\begin{exercise}
		We had to make a \emph{choice} while finding $ \mu_1$. Why does this choice not matter? Or does it? What if we had picked a different \emph{cube root} of $ \mu_1^3$?
	\end{exercise}
	
	\begin{exercise}
		Use your newfound superpower to find the roots of $x^3 - 3x + 2$ and $x^3 - 3x + 1$.
	\end{exercise}
	
	What if your cubic is happy and not depressed? Suppose the polynomial $ P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ has roots $ \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$. 
	\begin{exercise} $ $
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Find the coefficient of the polynomial whose roots are $ \beta_1 + k, \beta_2 + k, \beta_3 + k$.
			\item Find a $ k$ such that the coefficient of $ x^2$ vanishes. Notice that such a $ k$ only depends on the original coefficients $ a,b,c,d$.
			\item Do you see it now?
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{exercise}
	
	
	
	
	
	
	\subsection{Optional Exercises}
	
		Solutions of the polynomial equation $ x^n = 1$ are called \textbf{$n^{th}$ roots of unity}, where $ n$ is a positive integer. An $ n^{th}$ root of unity is called \textbf{primitive} if it not an $ m^{th}$ root of unity for any $ m < n$.
	
	\begin{exercise} $ $
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Find and plot all the $ n^{th}$ roots of unity. 
			\item Which of these are primitive? How many primitive roots are there?
		\end{enumerate}
		If $ \zeta_1, \cdots, \zeta_k$ are all the primitive $ n^{th}$ roots of unity then the polynomial $ \Phi_n(x) := \prod _{i=1}^k (x - \zeta_i)$ is called the $ n^{th}$ \textbf{cyclotomic polynomial}. Miraculously, all the coefficients of $ \Phi_n(x)$ are integers!
		\begin{enumerate}[resume]
			\item Find the cyclotomic polynomials $ \Phi_2(x), \Phi_3(x), \Phi_4(x)$.
			\item Find the cyclotomic polynomials $ \Phi_p(x)$ where $ p$ is prime.
			\item Factorize $ x^n - 1$ using cyclotomic polynomial\textbf{s}.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{exercise}

\section{Symmetry Groups}

Today we will explore symmetry groups of objects. Surprisingly, these will help us understand
how to solve cubic and quartic equations in future days.

\subsection{Symmetries of the triangle}

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:automorphisms}
	For $X$ a subset of $\br^n$, we define the {\bf automorphisms} of $X \subset \br^n$ to be the set of
	reflections and rotations of $\br^n$ which send $X$ to $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:triangle-automorphisms}
	Show that the an equilateral triangle in $\br^2$ has exactly $6$ automorphisms.
	Here, we include the {\bf identity automorphism}, denoted $\id$, which fixes every point of the triangle.
	Write down these automorphisms explicitly (in terms of rotations and reflections).
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:aut-is-group}
	Show that the composition of two automorphisms is again an automorphism.
	Also, show that every automorphism has an inverse. (That is, if $f: \br^n \ra \br^n$ is a reflection or rotation fixing $X$, show there is
	another automorphism $g: \br^n \ra \br^n$ fixing $X$ so that the compositions $f \circ g$ and $g \circ f$ fix every point of $X$.)
\end{exercise}
\begin{remark}
	\label{remark:}
	\autoref{exercise:aut-is-group} is another way of saying that the automorphisms of an object form a group.
\end{remark}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:r-s}
	Let $s$ denote the automorphism of the equilateral triangle which is rotation by $120\degree$
	and let $r$ denote a reflection interchanging two vertices of the equilateral triangle.
	Show that $r^2= \id,$ (where $r^2$ means $r \circ r$) $s^3 = \id$, and $rs = s^2r$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:}
	Show that all $6$ automorphisms from \autoref{exercise:triangle-automorphisms} can be expressed as compositions
	of the elements $r$ and $s$ defined in \autoref{exercise:r-s}. In this case we say that $r$ and $s$ {\bf generate}
	the automorphism group of the equilateral triangle.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Dihedral Groups}

We now generalize from the case of triangles to all polygons.
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:}
	Show that a regular $n$-gon in $\br^2$ has $2n$ automorphisms. This set of automorphims is called the {\bf dihedral group of size $2n$}, denote $D_{2n}$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:}
	Let $s$ denote the rotation of a regular $n$-gon by $(360/n) \degree$ about its center and $r$ denote an automorphism of a regular $n$-gon
	which is a reflection. Show that $r^2 = \id$, $s^n = \id$, and $rs = s^{n-1} r$. Show that $r$ and $s$ generate all automorphisms of the
	regular $n$-gon.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:}
	Show that $n$ of the $2n$ automorphisms of the regular $n$-gon are rotations.
	Show that the subset $D_{2n}$ of rotations is closed under composition. In this case we say that the rotations preserving the $n$-gon
	form a {\bf subgroup} of all automorphisms. This subgroup is called {\bf the cyclic group of order $n$}, denoted $C_n$.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Symmetric Groups}
\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:}
	We define the {\bf symmetric group on $n$ elements,} $S_n$ to be the set of bijections $\left\{ 1,2,\ldots, n \right\} \ra \left\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \right\}$
\end{definition}
Strictly speaking, the symmetric group is a little more than just this set. Given two bijections, you can compose them to get a third bijection.
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:}
	Show that $S_n$ (the symmetric group on $n$ elements) has size $n!$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:}
	Show that $S_3$ can be identified with the automorphisms of the equilateral triangle.
	{\it Hint:} Consider how the automorphisms act on the vertices of the triangle.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:}
	Show that the automorphisms of the tetrahedron in $\br^3$ are identified with $S_4$. {\it Hint:} Consider the action of the automorphisms of the $4$ vertices.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
	\label{exercise:tetrahedron-rotations}
	Show that inside the group of all automorphisms of the tetrahedron (of size $24 = 4!$, which is the size of $S_4$), there are $12$ rotations.
	Show that these rotations form a subgroup of $S_4$. This is known as the {\bf alternating group on $4$ elements}, denoted $A_4$.
\end{exercise}

{\it Your homework is to complete up through \autoref{exercise:tetrahedron-rotations}. If you finish that, and still have time try the following challenge questions.}

\begin{exercise}[Challenge 1]
	\label{exercise:}
	Inside all automorphisms of the cube, there is a subgroup of rotations. Identify that subgroup with $S_4$.
	Do the same for the octahedron.
	Show that inside the automorphisms of the cube, there is a subgroup of order $4$, whose $3$ non-identity elements consist of $180 \degree$ rotations.
	This is known as the {\bf Klein-$4$ group,} denoted $K_4$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}[Challenge 2]
	\label{exercise:}
	Determine the number of rotations of the dodecahedron. Do the same for the number of rotations of the icosahedron.
	Identify these two groups. That is, construct a bijection between these groups respecting composition.
	Show that these are subgroups of $S_5$. 
	{\it Possible hint:} For identifying this as a subgroup of $S_5$,
	one can show there are $5$ cubes which can be inscribed in a dodecahedron, and the rotations permute these cubes.
\end{exercise}
